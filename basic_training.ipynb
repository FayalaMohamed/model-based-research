        "\n",
        "This notebook implements a baseline policy training pipeline using Stable-Baselines3 (SB3) with vectorized environments, training directly on RAM observations. This serves as a comparison baseline for the V-JEPA2 and RSSM approaches.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Improvements\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Vectorized Environments**: Uses parallel environments for faster data collection\n",
        "- **Optimized PPO**: Uses SB3's highly optimized PPO implementation\n",
        "- **Better GPU Utilization**: Efficient batching and tensor operations\n",
        "\n",
        "## Environment Notes\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Google Colab**: Use GPU runtime for faster training\n",
        "- **Local Apple Silicon (M1/M2)**: Will use CPU (MPS support in SB3 is limited)\n",
        "- Adjust `n_envs` based on your CPU cores (4-8 is typical)\n"

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",
